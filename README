s3speedtest.sh will need to be called in a cron and log to a directory logged by the user.

* * * * * cd /path/to/script && ./speedtest.sh

Once that is in place, buildall.sh will need to be called in a cron every minute as well. The user will need write access
to the web directory where the images will be stored. There are instructions in the buildall.sh script to configure.

* * * * *    cd /path/to/script && ./buildall.sh
